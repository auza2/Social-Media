# Description
This is just adding on to the first project where we add a "share" button as the navigation controller's right bar item. It makes the bottom pop up with your basic sharing options. However, when I started this project the facebook and twitter shortcuts they used were depreciated. The only really new thing was the addition of a Target Property that gave permission to add a photo to the user's library.
